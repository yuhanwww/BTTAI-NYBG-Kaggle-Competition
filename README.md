## [BTTAI-NYBG-Kaggle-Competition](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/bttai-nybg-2024)

This is a kaggle competition co-held by [Break Through Tech AI](https://www.breakthroughtech.org/programs/the-ai-program/) & [New York Botanic Garden](https://www.nybg.org/) in Spring 2023.

I was a fellow in the program last year, and I participated in the competition with Srishti Kundu and other 2 members in Team Orchid. We won the <i>Most Submission</i> award at the end. (lol yes we submitted a lot but didn't reached the most accuracy) 

We were asked to use Machine Learning to classify NYBG's specimen collection, and we reached 97.7% accuracy in the end. 

Here's a snippet of the data:

I initiated the Exploratory Data Analysis and Data Processing process. See [WriteUp](https://github.com/yuhanwww/BTTAI-NYBG-Kaggle-Competition/blob/31230102b039160c9d666db4dbe6c376d8998749/NYBG_Data_Processing_WriteUp.pdf) and [code](https://github.com/yuhanwww/BTTAI-NYBG-Kaggle-Competition/blob/31230102b039160c9d666db4dbe6c376d8998749/Preliminary_model_Feb11.ipynb).

Later, Srishti and I leveraged SOFA Image Classification Models like VGGNet, Inception, and Xception for our model training. Xception reached the top performance.
